      "body": "Kenyans from all walks of life turned their eyes to the sky on the night of September 8, 2025, to witness a rare and dramatic total lunar eclipse, popularly known as the \"Blood Moon.\" The celestial event, one of the longest of its kind in recent memory, was a moment of scientific fascination and cultural significance across the nation.<br><br>The eclipse was the backdrop for a major new tourism initiative by the Kenya Tourism Ministry and the Kenya Space Agency. A dedicated \"astro-tourism\" experience was launched in Samburu County, an area known for its pristine, low-light-pollution skies. <br><br>Tourists and local communities gathered at Sopa Lodge in Samburu National Reserve, using telescopes and their naked eyes to watch the moon turn a deep, rusty red as it passed into Earth's shadow. The initiative aims to diversify Kenya's tourism offerings and capitalize on the country's clear skies to attract astronomy enthusiasts and adventure travelers.<br><br>While many viewed the eclipse through a modern, scientific lens, the event also brought to the forefront the rich and diverse cultural interpretations of celestial phenomena in Kenya.<br>For some indigenous communities, like the Samburu and Maasai, a lunar eclipse holds layered meanings. Some traditions view the reddened moon as an unfavorable omen, while others see it as a reflection of a struggle in the heavens. Some Maasai traditions involve loud chants and calls to encourage the spirit that has \"swallowed\" the moon to release it.<br>“It is a symbol of new beginnings and renewal,” Githunguri MP Gathoni Wamuchomba posted on social media.<br><br>Beyond the scientific and traditional views, the Blood Moon was a moment of shared experience for Kenyans. From cities to rural areas, people gathered to watch the spectacle. Social media was flooded with photos and videos of the eclipse, with many sharing their awe and wonder. The event served as a reminder of how astronomical occurrences can bridge the gap between scientific fact and lived human experience, bringing people together under a single, shared sky.",

They attribute these cases to teen pregnancies and students in tertiary institutions in the area who engage in casual sexual behavior, resorting to unsafe abortions.<br><br>In the latest case, two fetuses were found dumped in two different locations in Kisii estate, where those who discovered the fetuses were in shock and estimated them to be of six to eight months old. “These are babies all their body parts are well developed; hence they may be between 6 to 8 months. It’s sad to see someone kill a child, why not use family planning methods?” One of the witnesses said.<br><br>Catherine Mwende, a senior citizen in the area expressed her disappointment over what she termed as moral decay. “Children these days are engaging in casual sexual behaviors that leads to unwanted pregnancies or worse diseases. Having no ability to take care of babies, they resort to dangerous abortions, which is why we are seeing fetuses dumped all over,” she said.<br><br>Police have confirmed the growing trend, noting that cases of abandoned fetuses have sharply increased in recent months. “We are frequently called to collect fetuses dumped in various parts of Thika. It is an issue of serious concern,” an officer said.<br><br>Residents are now calling on authorities, religious leaders, and health officials to intensify sensitization on reproductive health and family planning, while also urging the government to crack down on illegal abortion practices in the area.<br><br>While the Kenyan Constitution (2010) permits abortion only when the mother’s life or health is at risk, many women and girls especially in urban and peri-urban areas such as Thika resort to illegal and unsafe procedures, often leading to medical complications or death.",

While the government said the new approach would ensure fairness and support the most vulnerable students, many learners say it has created new challenges.<br><br>“I applied for full government support, but I only got a partial scholarship and no HELB loan. My parents are unemployed, and now I'm struggling to raise fees,” said Janet Wanjiku, a second-year student at the University of Nairobi.<br>Under the new model, students are categorized into four levels; vulnerable, extremely needy, needy, and less needy  based on the Means Testing Instrument (MTI). However, some students claim the tool used to assess financial background is inaccurate or too general.<br><br>“The system doesn't consider that I have younger siblings in school. Just because my guardian owns a small business, they assumed I can afford university fees,” said Brian Kipkoech, a student at Moi University.<br><br>University administrators have also raised concerns. According to officials, delayed disbursement of funds has disrupted operations, and many students are at risk of deferring studies due to unpaid tuition.<br><br>Education Cabinet Secretary Julius Migos Ogamba has defended the model, saying it is still being fine-tuned and urged students to be patient.<br>But student leaders want urgent reforms.<br><br>“We are not against reforms, but the government must listen to our concerns. Education is a right, not a privilege,” said Mercy Achieng, a student leader from Kenyatta University.<br><br>As the academic year progresses, thousands of students are hoping for adjustments to the model to make university education more accessible and equitable for all.",

The 32-year-old mother of three, returning after seven years as a nanny in Qatar, has exchanged Doha's tall buildings for her adobe-walled residence<br><br>In 2017, Rosie left Nairobi, driven by unpaid school fees and an empty fridge. “I promised my kids a better life,” she recalls, stirring ugali in her one-room shack. Qatar offered KSh 50,000 monthly, a lifeline for her family.  <br><br>But reality stung. Sixteen-hour shifts, a confiscated passport, and no days off defined her Doha days. “I sang lullabies over WhatsApp,” Rosie says, her voice heavy. Her kids Juma, Amina, and Zawadi grew up with their grandmother.  <br>By 2020, Juma, then 10, quit school to sell scrap metal. Rosie's health crumbled under the weight of laundry baskets, her remittances shrinking. “Money wasn't enough,” she admits, eyes distant.  <br><br>This June, a call changed everything. Amina, 13, was slipping into depression, missing her mother's touch. Rosie quit, forfeiting three months' pay, and landed in Nairobi on July 28.  <br>The reunion at JKIA was tearful. Amina clung to Rosie, Juma grinned shyly, and Zawadi, 4, asked about \"Mama's palace.\" Kibera's reality leaky roofs, red dirt hit hard, but Rosie was home.  <br><br>Adjusting hasn't been easy. Juma's school fees drained her savings. Zawadi wonders why there's no pool. Yet, Rosie's resilience shines. She's turned her home into a daycare for 12 kids.  <br><br>Charging Ksh. 200 daily, Rosie teaches rhymes learned in Qatar. \"It's small, but it's ours,\" she says, watching toddlers play. Neighbours call her a hero, inspired by her grit.  <br><br>Community support has poured in. A church donated a solar lamp, a Sacco offered a microloan. Rosie's story, shared online, resonates across Kibera's tight-knit lanes.  <br><br>Her daycare grows, fuelled by skills and heart. “She's building futures,” says neighbor Fatuma, a single mother. Rosie's kids now dream bigger, Juma wants to play football, Amina sketches dresses.  <br><br>Central Bank data shows Kenyan women abroad send $4 billion yearly. Rosie's sacrifice mirrors theirs, but her return speaks louder, family over dollars.  <br>As dusk falls, Rosie shares sukuma wiki with her kids. \"We're poor in pockets, rich in love,\" she quips, ruffling Zawadi's braids. Kibera's stars twinkle above.  <br><br>August's rains flooded paths, but Rosie's homecoming lights Kibera. \"I chased gold, but found my heart here,\" she says, her smile a quiet triumph.",

      "body": "With the September sun shining on vacant lecture rooms throughout Kenya, the country's public universities come to a standstill, their hallways filled with the disappointment of countless stranded students.<br><br>The nationwide strike by university lecturers, now in its 11th day, erupted on September 17 after talks between the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) and the government crumbled. Led by UASU Secretary General Constantine Wasonga, dons demand the release of Sh2.73 billion in arrears from Phase Two of the 2021-2025 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), settlement of Sh7.9 billion from the 2017-2021 CBA, and the kick-off of negotiations for the 2025-2029 CBA.  <br><br>In a last-ditch effort, the National Treasury disbursed Sh2.5 billion on September 23 for CBA implementation, but union leaders dismissed it as a \"partial fix,\" insisting on full payment wired to accounts. Education CS Julius Ogamba urged UASU to withdraw the strike notice issued on September 10, calling for conciliation to salvage the disrupted 2025-2026 academic year.  <br><br>The Employment and Labour Relations Court suspended the strike on September 19, ordering talks and responses by September 30, with hearings set for October 6. Yet, lecturers remain defiant, picketing campuses from Nairobi to Kisumu, defying the interdict amid accusations of government foot-dragging.  <br><br>For first-year students, barely two weeks into orientation, the blow is crushing. At Pwani University in Mombasa, Flavina Namkuru, 19, stares at her blank timetable. \"We were just settling in when virtual classes vanished. Now, we're ghosts on campus,\" she says, joining a WhatsApp group for self-study tips.  <br><br>In Kisumu, Maseno University's Gloria Anyango, 18, has pivoted to her mitumba stall, hawking clothes to kill time. \"It's sad, but I'm turning lemons to lemonade. Still, exams loom; who'll teach us?\" she laments, her business booming amid the idle throng.  <br><br>The Kenya Universities Staff Union (KUSU), representing non-academic staff, has joined the fray, amplifying the shutdown. At the University of Nairobi, KUSU's Peter Waita rallies protesters: \"We've waited eight years for 2017 dues. No more games, wire the money or we stay out.\"  <br><br>Across 41 public universities, the ripple effects mount. Research labs idle, exams postponed, and libraries swell with aimless undergrads. Moi University's Acting UASU Secretary Dr. Dan Mukhwana warns: \"This ends only when CBAs are honored, no half-measures.\"  <br><br>Parents echo the outrage. From Eldoret, Robinson Kibet of KUSU urges recalls: \"Send kids home; no learning happens till payments clear.\" Social media erupts with #EndLecturersStrike, amassing 15,000 posts blending student pleas and union chants.  <br><br>The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) stands accused as the villain, ignoring a 2021 court order to boost budgets. UASU's Grace Nyongesa blasts: \"Taxes flow daily, yet higher education starves. This is systemic neglect.\"  <br><br>As September 27 dawns, uncertainty reigns. Private universities like Strathmore report enrollment spikes, but for the 80% in public institutions, dreams defer. Ian Omondi, a third-year engineering student at Egerton, scrolls job sites: \"Floods delayed us last year; now this? Our futures hang by a thread.\"  <br><br>The cycle of strikes, last year's two-week halt still fresh which exposes deeper woes in Kenya's education funding, now at Sh82 billion for 2025-2026, up from Sh44 billion in 2022 but strained by arrears.  <br><br>With court deadlines looming, Ogamba's plea for dialogue rings hollow to Wasonga: \"Letters won't feed families. Act, or the academic year crumbles.\" For now, Kenya's ivory towers stand silent, a stark reminder that unpaid promises echo loudest in empty halls.",

MLN, a viral disease spread by pests, has slashed yields by up to 90% in affected regions since 2011.  <br><br>Dr. Mwangi, 41, a plant geneticist, led the five-year project. \"We screened 200 maize lines and identified three with natural resistance,\" she said, peering through a microscope. The team crossbred these with local hybrids, boosting resilience without genetic modification.  <br><br>Field trials in Naivasha and Bomet showed the new variety, dubbed \"KALRO Shield,\" yielded 8 tons per hectare, double the output of standard maize under MLN pressure. \"It's a game-changer,\" said farmer John Kiptoo, 50, from Bomet.  <br><br>The project, funded by a KSh 300 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, partnered with CIMMYT, a global maize research body. \"Kenya's innovation leads Africa,\" said CIMMYT's Dr. Sarah Okoth.  <br><br>Challenges remain. MLN's spread, worsened by climate-driven pest surges, threatens 30% of Kenya's maize belt. Scaling up seed production for KALRO Shield could take two years, per KALRO's director, Dr. Eliud Kireger.  <br><br>Farmers like Amina Wanjiku, 38, from Nakuru, are eager. \"Last year, I lost half my crop. This gives us hope,\" she said, inspecting trial plots. Maize supports 80% of Kenya's food security, per Ministry of Agriculture data.  <br><br>The science isn't flawless. Some varieties showed reduced resistance in humid coastal areas. \"We're refining for adaptability,\" Dr. Mwangi noted, tweaking DNA markers in her lab.  <br><br>Local communities rallied behind the effort. In Bomet, farmers donated land for trials. \"We trust our scientists,\" said elder Mary Chebet. On X, #KALROShield trended with 3,000 posts praising the work.  <br><br>The government pledged KSh 100 million to fast-track seed distribution by 2026. \"This is science for the people,\" said Agriculture CS Andrew Karanja at the launch.  <br><br>Dr. Mwangi's team is already eyeing sorghum and millet. \"We're not just fighting a disease; we're securing futures,\" she said, her lab buzzing with purpose.  <br><br>Kenya's maize fields, scarred by MLN, now glimpse recovery. KALRO Shield, born of local grit and global collaboration, promises harvests that endure.  <br><br>As August's rains nourish test plots, farmers wait, hopeful. \"This maize is our shield,\" Amina said, her hands in the soil, dreaming of full granaries.",

Homes in the Naivasha-adjacent village huddled against the tracks that were pulverized in minutes. \"The water came like a beast, roaring from the hills,\" recalls 62-year-old Mama Grace Wanjiku, her hands trembling as she clutches a faded photo of her grandson, swept away at 7.  <br><br>By dawn, the valley floor was a graveyard of twisted metal and splintered timber. Rescue teams from Nakuru County pulled 32 bodies from the debris, but the toll climbed as mud graves yielded more. \"We dug with bare hands, calling names into the void,\" says volunteer rescuer Joseph Mwangi, 35, his boots still caked in the silt of memory.  <br><br>Mai Mahiu, a farming hamlet of 5,000 reliant on Lake Naivasha's bounty, had weathered dry spells before. But climate-fueled downpours up 30% since 2020, per Kenya Meteorological Department data, overwhelmed outdated drains. \"The government built that rail for progress, but it became our dam of death,\" Wanjiku laments.  <br><br>Among the lost was teacher Elias Kiprop, 28, who herded 15 pupils to safety before the current claimed him. His widow, Lydia, 25, now tends their orphaned 2-year-old alone. \"He was our light; now we stumble in dark,\" she says, folding tiny uniforms stained with grief.  <br><br>Survivors like 19-year-old mechanic David Otieno lost everything twice, first to the flood, then to looters in the chaos. His workshop, a tin-roofed dream, lies buried under a meter of muck. \"I rebuilt after the 2018 floods. This time, my spirit broke,\" he admits, salvaging a wrench from the rubble.  <br><br>Aid trickled in slowly: KSh 10 million from the National Drought Management Authority for tents and food. Red Cross teams distributed blankets to 1,200 displaced families now crammed in Naivasha's schools. Yet, questions linger. \"Why no early warnings? Our phones stayed silent,\" demands village elder Samuel Njoroge, 70.  <br><br>The floods' ripple hit hard. Maize fields, Mai Mahiu's lifeline, drowned under sludge, slashing harvests by 70%. With 80% of households below the poverty line, hunger stalks the survivors. \"We eat one meal a day, posho and wild greens,\" Otieno says, his frame gaunt.  <br><br>Community bonds, forged in fire, hold firm. Women like Wanjiku form savings groups, pooling KSh 50 weekly for seeds. Youth dig communal latrines, warding off cholera's shadow. \"Tragedy stripped us bare, but not our fight,\" Njoroge says, leading a prayer circle at the flood's edge.  <br><br>Nationwide, the 2024 rains killed 238, per Interior Ministry tallies, exposing Kenya's vulnerability. Experts at the University of Nairobi blame deforestation and shoddy infrastructure. \"Mai Mahiu is a warning, act now or lose more valleys,\" warns climate researcher Dr. Amina Hassan.  <br><br>On X, #MaiMahiuFloods drew 10,000 posts, blending outrage with calls for climate justice. Donors chipped in Ksh 5 million via M-Changa, funding a memorial garden where wildflowers now nod over the lost.  <br><br>As August's sun bakes the cracked earth, Lydia plants sunflowers on Elias's grave. \"He'd want beauty from pain,\" she whispers. The floods recede, but Mai Mahiu's wounds fester a stark reminder that nature's fury spares no one.  <br><br>In the quiet evenings, survivors gather by the tracks, sharing tales under starlit skies. \"We lost our dead, but not our dawn,\" Wanjiku says, her voice rising like a hymn. From tragedy's depths, resilience rises, one stubborn seed at a time.",

      "body": "NAIROBI — Kenya’s education system is undergoing sweeping reforms even as the government confronts significant budgetary constraints that threaten some of its free‐education commitments.<br>In the fiscal year 2025-26, the education sector was allocated KSh 702.7 billion, equivalent to 28% of the national budget, up from 27.6% in 2024-25. But despite the increased total, key programs face deep cuts. Primary school free‐education funds were trimmed from KSh 9.1 billion to about KSh 7 billion, while junior secondary and secondary capitation funds have also been reduced.<br><br>Education Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi said the capitation reductions — particularly for free primary, junior secondary, and free day secondary education — are necessary as the government reallocates funding to cover the rising cost of national examinations. Some of these funds will go to producing, invigilating, and distributing exam materials, an expense that has ballooned in recent years.<br><br>Despite the financial pressures, the government has matched the reforms with ambitious policy and structural changes intended to improve access, quality, and relevance of education. One of the headline reforms is the transition from the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) to a broader Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) model, aimed at better alignment with both the job market and the realities of secondary and tertiary education.<br><br>To support these aims, Kenya has launched a large‐scale teacher recruitment drive. Since 2022, roughly 76,000 new primary and secondary teachers have been hired; an additional 24,000 are expected by December 2025, bringing the total to about 100,000 recruited in three years.<br>Infrastructure is also a major pillar of the reforms. The government reports that about 23,000 new classrooms have been constructed across the country since 2022 — 16,000 through the Ministry of Education and 7,000 via the Constituencies Development Fund.  In addition, plans are underway to build 1,600 science laboratories, particularly in underserved areas and in schools offering STEM‐oriented paths.<br><br>Still, some education stakeholders are raising concerns over the forthcoming end to government‐funded examination fee waivers, a policy in place for about a decade. From 2025, the government is exploring a cost‐sharing model for exam fees, meaning some parents—particularly those from more affluent households—may be required to contribute. Vulnerable learners are expected to retain full support under new measures.<br><br>In special education, Kenya is moving “from policy to inclusive classrooms,” with schools increasingly integrating learners with disabilities into mainstream settings, use of assistive devices, early assessments, and teacher training targeting inclusive pedagogies.<br><br>Going forward, the success of KBET (and CBET) will depend not just on policy design but on consistent funding, grassroots engagement (teachers, parents, students), and strong monitoring to ensure reforms reach remote, poor, and special needs learners.<br>",

This crisis is characterized by a massive deficit in the student capitation fund and the difficulties many institutions face in implementing the government's new financing model.<br><br>The current dispute centers on the implementation of the 2017-2021 CBA and the payment of salary arrears to nearly 30,000 striking workers. The nationwide strike has stopped learning, jeopardized research, and impacted graduation dates since it began in September 2025. The Ministry of Education has called for conciliation efforts. However, the unions maintain their position that work will not resume until their financial demands are met. The stalemate continues to disrupt the university's learning and the well-being of the striking employees.<br>",

Jubilee rises to restore hope.\" The event, his first major outing since 2022, spotlighted Matiang'i, the ex-Interior CS who managed the last election's calm.<br>  <br>The declaration has splintered Kenya Kwanza, with MPs like Mwangi Kiunjuri threatening to cut Kenyatta's Sh1.3 million retirement pay. \"He's undermining the leadership he created,\" Kiunjuri said on October 6.  <br><br>Leveraging Mt Kenya loyalty where 42% still favor him per Infotrak, Kenyatta aims to erode Ruto's base. Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua retorted from Nyeri: \"Mt Kenya rejects yesterday's shadows for tomorrow's light.\"  <br><br>Matiang'i, 50, demurred: \"I'll serve if the people call, guided by Uhuru's vision.\" Jubilee's funding, tied to Kenyatta networks, positions it as a \"third force\" against Ruto and Raila Odinga.  <br>Odinga, chasing an AU role, tweeted support: \"Uhuru voices the betrayed masses. Accountability unites us.\" Azimio insiders fear vote fragmentation, however.  <br><br>Public fury; 15% inflation, delayed CBAs, 60 protest deaths in 2024 per Human Rights Watch bolsters Kenyatta's narrative. Gatundu farmer Joseph Mwangi, 70, said: \"He'll battle the hunger his successors ignored.\"  <br><br>Ruto extended an August 1 olive branch at State House, but tensions simmer. Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen pledged Sh500 million in Mt Kenya roads on October 5 to reclaim support.  <br>#UhuruReturns hit 20,000 X posts, mixing phoenix imagery with #HustlerNation barbs. Boniface Mwangi posted: \"Dismantle dynasties or join them, Uhuru?\"  <br><br>Analyst Judy Muthoga warns: \"Post-tenure revivals flop, KANU's 2002 fate looms.\" Jubilee SG Jeremiah Kioni counters with youth-focused branch drives.  <br><br>The 2027 landscape heats: IEBC delays under NADCO, ethnic risks in by-elections like Narok's. Freedom House praises vibrancy but critiques \"ethnic deals.\"  <br><br>In Uhuru Park, activist Wanjiku Mwende, 22, weighs in: \"Change without feuds? I'm listening.\"  <br>Kenyatta's return isn't just personal vendetta, it's a strategic masterstroke tapping into disillusionment with Ruto's \"bottom-up\" model, which critics say has morphed into elite enrichment. With voter registration crawling at under 10% turnout in key regions, Jubilee's grassroots push could siphon disaffected youth and women voters, per a recent TIFA survey showing 35% national dissatisfaction with the administration.  <br><br>Insiders reveal Kenyatta has quietly mended fences with Odinga's inner circle, hinting at a potential Azimio-Jubilee pact to form a \"grand opposition\" bloc. \"The handshake 2.0 is in the works,\" whispered a source close to Matiang'i, though Odinga aides deny it, calling it \"speculative noise.\"  <br><br>For Ruto, the calculus is dire. His approval ratings hover at 38%, battered by floods, strikes, and a ballooning debt at 70% of GDP. Gachagua's aggressive Mt Kenya consolidation through harambees and anti-tax rhetoric may backfire if Kenyatta peels away moderates. \"This is a wake-up call; ignore it, and 2027 slips away,\" Muthoga added.  <br><br>As October unfolds, Kenyatta's shadow tests the hustler nation's resilience. Will Jubilee's phoenix soar, or crash like predecessors? In a polity scarred by dynasties and deals, one thing's clear: Kenya's political theatre just got its star back on stage, script rewritten for redemption or revenge.<br>",

Last month, a pilot in Eastlands disconnected 5,000 homes, recovering Sh150 million in two weeks, but sparking outrage over timing amid the ongoing lecturers' strike and fuel price hikes.<br><br>Nairobi's water woes trace to chronic underinvestment: The firm supplies just 600 million litres daily against a 1.2 billion demand, per Water Services Regulatory Board data, forcing 40 per cent of residents to rely on cartels charging up to Sh50 per 20-litre jerrycan. \"We're not punishing; we're surviving,\" Onyango defended, pledging reconnection fees waived for prompt payers.  <br><br>Businesses reel from the threat. Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, owing Sh200 million, has appealed for a payment plan, warning disruptions could snarl East Africa's busiest hub. \"One day without water cascades into hygiene crises and flight delays,\" said Airports CEO Alex Gitari, echoing fears from the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (KAHC), whose members face Sh300 million in collective dues.  <br><br>The move aligns with President William Ruto's fiscal austerity push, including a Sh500 billion revenue target for 2025-26, but critics like economist Aly-Khan Satchu blast it as \"tone-deaf\" amid 7.5 per cent unemployment. \"Hitting the poor hardest while elites evade taxes? This fuels inequality,\" Satchu tweeted, igniting #WaterWars with 8,000 posts slamming NCWSC's leaky infrastructure.<br><br> Community backlash brews. In Kibera, activist Boniface Mwangi rallied 500 residents on October 6: \"Water is a right, not a privilege for payers.\" Slum dwellers, billed irregularly due to unmetered connections, fear cholera spikes, last year's outbreak killed 20 after similar cutoffs. NCWSC counters with a Sh2 billion metering drive, but rollout lags behind targets.  <br><br>Economically, the disconnections could shave 0.2 per cent off Nairobi's GDP, per a Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) snapshot, hitting informal sectors like jua kali artisans hardest. \"No water, no welding; we're dead in the water,\" lamented Dagoretti welder John Mwangi, 45, whose Sh500 monthly bill triples in dry spells.  <br><br>Government allies push back. Environment CS Roselinda Soipan Tuya announced Sh1 billion in emergency boreholes on October 7, while Treasury allocated Sh300 million to NCWSC for debt relief. Yet, opposition MP James Gaichuhie decried: \"Ruto's 'hustler' fund starves while water flows to cronies.\"  <br><br>Broader ripples: Kenya's utilities sector, burdened by Sh50 billion in national arrears, mirrors the KPC privatisation furore, where sales fund bailouts but risk monopolies. NCWSC, 100 per cent county-owned, eyes public-private partnerships for Sh20 billion in upgrades.  <br><br>As October 15 nears, panic-buying jerrycans surges in markets. \"I'll pay half now, beg later,\" said single mother Fatuma Ali, 38, juggling school fees and rations. For Nairobi's 5 million thirsty souls, this isn't just a bill, it's a deluge of distrust in a system where every drop counts toward survival.<br>",

      "title": "Nicki Minaj and Cardi B: The Feud That Refuses to Die",
      "body": "The long-running rivalry between rap titans Nicki Minaj and Cardi B reignited last week in a blistering three-day social media war, one that dragged their young children into the crossfire and drew condemnation from fans, fellow artists, and even 50 Cent.<br><br>What began as a dispute over album sales for Cardi’s new release, Am I the Drama? quickly spiraled into personal attacks, with allegations of drug abuse, fertility struggles, and cruel remarks about their children, Kulture (7), Blossom (2), and Minaj’s son, Papa Bear (4).<br><br>The escalation peaked on September 29, when Minaj mocked Cardi’s album, priced $4.99 during release week, despite its No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200 with 199,600 units. She paired the jab with digs at Cardi’s pregnancy reveal. Cardi fired back, calling Minaj “Cocaine Barbie” and twisting lyrics from Minaj’s Magnet to reference her brother’s imprisonment for child rape. Minaj retaliated with AI-generated memes of Cardi as Barney the Dinosaur and claims she was pregnant again amid rumors of HPV exposure.<br><br>By October 1, ironically Papa Bear’s birthday, things turned vicious. Minaj called Kulture a “roach” and “monkey,” before issuing a sarcastic “apology,” saying;<br>“Dear Kulture, truth is: I did all of this for a bigger purpose... you’re a cute child & lots of kids have cute little funny looking gums before they grow into all of their features. I apologize.”<br>Cardi dismissed the note as backhanded, firing back with a message aimed at Papa Bear, accusing Minaj of drug use and neglect. She also alleged Minaj’s son was “nonverbal,” while Minaj claimed Cardi had mocked her child for years.<br><br>The feud soon spilled over into a broader industry beef. Minaj accused Cardi of perjury and fraud, took shots at Roc Nation executives, and urged boycotts of Cardi-linked brands. Cardi threatened a face-to-face confrontation, saying, “I’M NOT THROWING AWAY MY CAREER... I’LL SEE YOU WHEN I SEE YOU”, while announcing her fourth pregnancy with NFL star Stefon Diggs, which reignited Minaj’s fertility taunts.<br><br>Public reaction was swift and damning. On X, one viral post lamented, “This Cardi B and Nicki Minaj beef got too serious… Y’all both could have left the kids out.” Hip-hop veterans 50 Cent and Waka Flocka Flame called the spat “toxic” and “corny,” while Charlamagne tha God suggested deeper personal wounds were at play. Even SZA, caught in Minaj’s stray shots, fired back online. Ironically, all the chaos boosted Cardi’s numbers. Am I the Drama? is expected to place 10 songs on next week’s Hot 100, surpassing Minaj’s Pink Friday 2.<br><br>This feud isn’t new. It traces back to 2017, when Cardi’s breakout Bodak Yellow challenged Minaj’s long reign. The tension boiled over during the Motorsport rollout in 2018,  when Cardi accused Minaj of sabotaging her verse, culminating in Cardi throwing a shoe at Minaj during New York Fashion Week. Since then, both have traded subtle jabs, but 2025’s eruption feels more personal, fueled by Cardi’s post-divorce resurgence and Minaj’s looming 2026 project.<br><br>As of Sunday, the 5th, both artists have gone quiet, though the silence feels temporary. The Barbz and Bardi Gang continue to wage war online, turning insults into trending topics. No lawsuits or reconciliations have followed, but the feud underscores hip-hop’s cutthroat landscape, where queens fight not just for charts, but for legacy.<br>",

      "body": "A sharp rise in violent theft incidents across Nairobi County has sparked growing concern among residents and authorities alike, as criminals become increasingly brazen in their operations.<br><br>One of the most harrowing incidents occurred recently in Kayole, where 18-year-old Clinton Otieno was fatally stabbed by a gang of thugs during a nighttime robbery. Otieno, who was walking home with a friend, reportedly resisted the attackers’ demands before being stabbed multiple times. His companion sustained serious injuries and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Police say investigations are ongoing to apprehend the assailants.<br><br>In another violent episode in Eastleigh, a 20-year-old domestic worker, Hakimo Muhidin Ali, was brutally assaulted during a robbery inside her employer’s apartment. According to court reports, the suspects, including a Ugandan nanny and an accomplice, used a hammer to beat the victim before making away with gold jewellery, a laptop, and cash. The victim suffered head and leg injuries and required extensive medical treatment.<br><br>A separate confrontation in Kilimani saw police engage suspected robbers in a dramatic midnight shootout along Tigoni Road. Two suspects were shot dead while another escaped with injuries. Security officers recovered firearms, pangas, and stolen items at the scene. The incident has heightened anxiety in one of Nairobi’s most affluent suburbs, long considered relatively secure.<br>Police have intensified operations along major roads such as Thika Highway, Waiyaki Way, and Jogoo Road, following an upsurge in attacks targeting pedestrians and motorists during evening hours. At least 38 suspects have been arrested in recent crackdowns, according to official police reports.<br><br>Nairobi County Police Commander Adam Kiptoo confirmed that patrols have been stepped up in hotspot areas and appealed to the public to remain vigilant. “We are determined to dismantle criminal networks operating within the city. Our officers are working around the clock to ensure residents are safe and offenders are brought to justice,” he said.<br><br>Security analysts have linked the rise in theft-related violence to high unemployment and economic hardship, especially among youth in informal settlements. “The pattern of urban theft has evolved from opportunistic petty crime to organized, violent robbery,” noted criminologist Dr. Sarah Wambui. “Unless socioeconomic drivers such as joblessness and poverty are addressed, law enforcement alone cannot provide a lasting solution.”<br><br>Meanwhile, residents and business owners continue to urge both the national and county governments to improve street lighting, expand CCTV surveillance, and strengthen community policing.<br><br>As the city’s crime wave intensifies, many Nairobians have been forced to alter their routines—avoiding certain routes, closing businesses early, and relying on private transport—in a bid to stay safe.<br>",

Her stride, a blend of grace and grit, electrified 10,000 fans. <br> <br>“This is my rebirth,” Kipyegon beamed, her breath steady post-race. After a 2024 Olympic silver marred by a controversial disqualification scare, she’s hungry for Paris gold.  <br><br>The Eldoret native trained under coach Julius Kirwa, battling altitude and a nagging ankle injury from June’s rains. “Faith’s heart is her engine,” Kirwa said, praising her dawn sprints.  <br>Her rival; Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay and Australia’s Jessica Hull, loom large. Tsegay’s 3:50.77 world record taunts, but Kipyegon’s pace suggests she’s closing the gap.  <br><br>Nairobi’s trials doubled as qualifiers for the African Championships. Kipyegon’s teammate, Nelly Chepchirchir, 25, clocked 4:01.12, securing her spot. “Faith pushes us all,” Chepchirchir said.  <br>Kenya’s athletics machine hums despite funding woes. Athletics Kenya’s Sh200 million budget, cut 10% post-2024 floods, strains travel plans. Still, 60 athletes qualified for Paris.  <br><br>Kipyegon’s journey inspires. In Iten, her hometown, schoolgirls mimic her stride on red-dirt tracks. “She’s our beacon,” said teacher Mary Cheruiyot, 40, hosting watch parties.  <br>Sponsors like Nike and Safaricom fuel her run, injecting Sh50 million into her training camp. “It’s for Kenya, not just me,” Kipyegon said, eyeing a third Olympic medal.<br><br> Challenges linger: Paris’s heat and Kenya’s economic crunch 15% inflation test logistics. Yet, Kirwa remains bullish: “Faith’s legs will outrun any storm.”  <br>The trials saw 5,000 youth cheer, a nod to Kenya’s athletics legacy, which boasts 113 Olympic medals since 1964. Kipyegon’s record run adds fire to that flame.  <br><br>Her next stop: a Dubai training camp in November. “I’m not done breaking clocks,” she vowed, her eyes fixed on Paris’s distant horizon.  <br><br>As Nyayo’s dust settles, Kipyegon’s sprint rekindles national pride. In a land of runners, her comeback isn’t just personal, its Kenya’s heartbeat, pounding toward global glory.<br>",

The manoeuvre blocked other road users and created a dangerous obstruction.<br><br>The altercation was captured by journalist Larry Madowo. In the video, MP Orero is heard encouraging his driver to continue, even daring Madowo to take the recording to President William Ruto, a hint at perceived impunity.<br>The driver then hurled verbal insults at the journalist, including being heard telling him “peleka kwa Ruto” (take it to Ruto) and calling him “takataka” meaning “trash.”<br><br>The case was pursued by police, who had earlier declared their intention to investigate after the video went viral, given that the behaviour seemed to violate the Traffic Act and common law on reckless driving and obstruction.<br>In Milimani Law Courts, before Senior Principal Magistrate Rose Ndombi, George Oduor pleaded guilty to the charge of dangerous overtaking.<br><br>The magistrate ruled that, despite mitigation (the driver claimed he was rushing to get someone to the airport), the law prescribed a maximum fine of KSh 100,000 or up to 12 months in prison for such an offence. The maximum penalty was imposed.<br><br>The debate has resurrected calls for stricter oversight of drivers serving politicians and for clearer protocols for motorcades and VIP travel so that traffic rules are respected and road users are not endangered.<br>The Kibera MP road obstruction saga is a story not just of one driver’s reckless overtaking, but of law, equality, and public trust. While one fine does not erase years of VIP-style road privileges, it may be a step toward reminding everyone – regardless of status – that the road rules apply to all. How much this moment shifts culture remains to be seen.<br>",

      "body": "Former Kenyan Prime Minister and veteran opposition leader Raila Amolo Odinga has died at the age of 80 after suffering a cardiac arrest while undergoing treatment in India. Odinga, a towering figure in Kenyan and African politics for decades, collapsed during a morning walk at an Ayurvedic treatment facility in Koothattukulam, Kerala, on Wednesday morning. His death creates an immediate and profound leadership vacuum in Kenya's political opposition.<br><br>Indian media reported that medical staff rushed Odinga to Devamatha Hospital in the nearby Ernakulam district, but doctors pronounced him dead shortly after 9:50 a.m. local time. Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the cardiac event to news agencies, noting resuscitation efforts failed. Odinga had been in India for specialized Ayurvedic treatment, a facility his daughter had previously visited for her vision. The Kenyan Embassy in Delhi is coordinating efforts for the repatriation of his body.<br><br>Odinga's nearly five-decade career defined modern Kenyan democracy. Born in 1945, the son of Kenya's first Vice-President, he courageously endured years of detention without trial under the single-party regime of Daniel arap Moi for his pro-democracy activism. He served as the Prime Minister of Kenya from 2008 to 2013 in a power-sharing arrangement that ended post-election violence.Despite running for the presidency unsuccessfully five times—most recently in 2022—he remained a hugely influential leader, consistently demanding electoral justice and constitutional reform.<br><br>Leaders across the globe immediately expressed shock and grief at the news. Kenyan President William Ruto led the nation in mourning, while former Chief Justice David Maraga called Odinga a \"patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa,\" posting his sentiments on X.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Odinga as a \"towering statesman\" and a \"cherished friend of India.\"<br><br>Odinga’s passing leaves the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party without its unifying force ahead of the 2027 general elections. Known affectionately by supporters as \"Baba,\" his populist rallies mobilized masses, demonstrating his powerful connection to ordinary Kenyans. \"Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country,\" Maraga added. Political analysts suggest Odinga’s death will trigger a rapid realignment of political forces, challenging the stability of the current political landscape and the recent truce he struck with the government.<br>",

      "body": "Tonight, Kenyans will have their eyes turned skywards as the country witnesses one of nature’s most mesmerizing spectacles.  A total lunar eclipse, popularly known as the “blood moon’’ will grace the Kenyan Skies from 8:31 p.m., when the Earth’s shadow will completely cover the moon, painting it deep red. This phenomena will be visible across many places in the country with exceptional viewing places especially known for star gazing , among them the Mt. Kenya National Park where this reader joined natures’ enthusiasts among them academicians for a week long camp in anticipation of this historical, once in a lifetime occurence.<br><br>Astronomy enthusiasts and curious onlookers started flocking to the high-altitude region of Mount Kenya National Park  at dawn a week ago where clear skies promise an unobstructed view of the celestial event.<br>“This is one of those moments where science meets beauty,” says Dr. Miriam Kilonzo, an astrophysicist at the University of Nairobi. “A total lunar eclipse like this occurs only when the Earth perfectly aligns between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. The reddish glow happens because sunlight is refracted through the Earth’s atmosphere. It’s like watching every sunrise and sunset on Earth reflected on the moon.<br><br>According to the Kenya Space Agency, the eclipse will begin at 6:28 p.m. with the penumbral phase, but the real show starts at 8:31 p.m. when the total eclipse begins. The moon will reach its darkest and most striking point around 9:12 p.m., before gradually returning to normal by 11:55 p.m.<br>For locals in the foothills of Mount Kenya, the event has stirred excitement and curiosity. Samuel Mwangi, a tour guide in Nanyuki, said many visitors have booked night hikes and camping experiences to catch the rare view. “We’ve had tourists coming from as far as Mombasa and even Uganda,” he said. “People want to see the blood moon from the highest point possible. It’s a great experience.”<br><br>But beyond the scientific wonder, cultural interpretations still thrive. Mama Gakenia, an elderly woman from Meru County, smiled as she shared her traditional view. “When the moon turns red, our grandparents used to say it’s the earth cleansing itself as  a sign of renewal.’’<br><br>Experts have advised that no special glasses are needed for viewing as it is safe to watch with the naked eye. However, binoculars or telescopes can enhance the spectacle.<br>Warm clothing is recommended for those planning to stay outdoors, especially in high-altitude areas where temperatures drop after sunset.<br><br>As Kenyans gather under the open sky, the red moon serves as a reminder of the shared wonder that binds humanity across science, culture, and curiosity. “Moments like this connect us,” Dr. Kilonzo reflected. “They remind us how beautiful our universe can be.”<br>",

      "body": "A long-awaited ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas has taken effect, bringing the first significant pause in the devastating two-year conflict in Gaza and leading to the release of all remaining living Israeli hostages. The deal, brokered through intense international mediation, marks a critical initial step in a broader peace plan.<br><br>The truce, the first phase of a broader 20-point peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, saw all 20 living Israeli hostages returned on Monday, days after Israel's cabinet formally approved the arrangement. In exchange, Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.<br><br>The agreement mandates a significant surge in humanitarian aid, with up to 600 trucks per day expected to enter Gaza, according to the White House plan. However, the fragile truce faced an immediate test on Tuesday when Israel halved the aid flow, citing delays in the return of the remains of deceased hostages by Hamas.<br>The sentiment of cautious relief and high stakes was palpable. Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official and lead negotiator, reflected this during a televised speech, saying, “We declare today that we have reached an agreement to end the war and the aggression against our people.” Meanwhile, families of the hostages expressed \"overwhelming joy and relief\" at the news of their loved ones' return, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.<br><br>The conflict, which erupted on October 7, 2023, following a massive attack by Hamas on southern Israel, has led to a major Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The operation has resulted in widespread destruction and the deaths of tens of thousands, overwhelmingly Palestinians, according to Gaza authorities. Previous attempts at sustained ceasefires, including one in November 2023 and another in March 2025, failed to hold. <br><br>This breakthrough deal, mediated primarily by the US, Egypt, and Qatar, requires a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to new agreed-upon lines within Gaza, focusing on the immediate exchange of captives and prisoners and a massive boost in aid before tackling thornier issues like Hamas disarmament and future governance of the enclave. The US has committed to sending approximately 200 troops to Israel to help monitor the ceasefire and facilitate aid delivery.<br>",

In many areas, the rallies were met with heavy police presence. Officers ordered crowds to disperse, speeches were interrupted and some demonstrators were arrested. Restrictions were also reported on social media posts about the events.<br><br>The protests follow growing allegations of abductions, intimidation of critics and harassment of journalists. Human rights groups say they have documented cases of politically motivated assaults and disappearances. In a recent incident that drew international attention, two activists from Kenya and Uganda claimed they were detained, tortured and then deported after entering Tanzania to support opposition activity.<br><br>Observers believe the unrest is linked to tensions surrounding the general elections scheduled for 29 October. Opposition leaders and civil society groups accuse the government of creating a hostile political environment by curbing dissent, silencing the press and limiting the independence of electoral institutions. Police have also blocked several planned demonstrations by lawyers, activists and opposition members.<br><br>The wave of protests and the forceful responses have left many citizens anxious. Residents in affected areas say businesses close during rallies, transport is disrupted and checkpoints slow movement. Some families of those reported missing live with constant fear while young people and students worry about being caught up in confrontations.<br><br>Despite the risks, many Tanzanians remain determined to make their voices heard. In Dar es Salaam, one woman held a sign that read \"My voice matters\" and told reporters, \"I will not be silenced by fear.\" Similar sentiments were echoed in other cities as crowds chanted for justice and democracy.<br><br>As the election date approaches, the demonstrations highlight both the determination of citizens to push for change and the uncertainty of how the government will respond. For many, the protests of 29 September mark either a turning point or yet another warning of the fragile state of freedoms in Tanzania.",

Lissu, who survived an assassination attempt in 2017, is faced with multiple politically linked charges.<br><br>Despite holding valid travel documents, the Kenyans were detained for hours at the airport, denied legal representation and deported on the next available flight to Nairobi.<br><br>\"No justification or formal explanation was given for the refusal of entry,\" said Martha Karua. \"We were treated like criminals in a country we consider part of a shared community.\"<br><br>Filed under the auspices of the EALS, the petition seeks a formal declaration that Tanzania violated regional laws, compensation for the affected individuals and removal of \"refusal of entry\" stamps from their passports.<br><br>Abubakar emphasized that the deportation undermines regional unity, noting that the integrity of the East African Community depends on the free movement of its citizens.<br><br>\"This case goes beyond personal rights, it's a defense of the legal foundations of East African integration,\" he said<br><br>LSK President Faith Odhiambo condemned the deportations, confirming that the society fully supports the petition since one of its council members, Gloria Kimani, was directly affected.<br><br>\"This action flies in the face of international diplomacy, mutual respect and the rule of law. We demand accountability,\" said Odhiambo.<br><br>Meanwhile, the incident has sparked debate on regional cooperation and diplomatic respect within the EAC. Neither the Tanzanian government nor its immigration department has issued an official explanation.<br><br>Critics argue that the deportation reflects growing intolerance toward external scrutiny of internal legal matters. On X (formerly Twitter), Tundu Lissu thanked the Kenyan delegation for their solidarity, calling the deportation \"a stark reminder that freedom of movement and democracy remain fragile in parts of East Africa.\"<br><br>The EACJ, based in Arusha, is expected to begin hearings later this year. Legal experts say the case could set a precedent for how EAC citizens are treated and how the Common Market Protocol is enforced.<br><br>Should the petitioners win, Tanzania may be compelled to compensate the six Kenyans and lift their entry bans, strengthening regional unity and reaffirming respect for the rule of law.",

The church has its headquarters in Jebrok Vihiga County and observes Friday as its Sabbath day, believing it to be the day of Jesus Christ's crucifixion.<br><br>The headquarters has been embroiled in internal conflicts and disputes over leadership and land ownership. The current dispute highlights the challenges faced by religious institutions in managing their properties and resolving internal conflicts.<br><br>The court case which has been ongoing for approximately 15 years, was marked by intense land disputes between the church followers and leaders leading to the church's closure and resulted in at least five deaths and multiple injuries.<br><br>The Hamisi Law Court delivered the verdict with Resident Magistrate Nicodemus Moseti ruling that there was sufficient evidence to convict Mweresa.<br><br>Mweresa's leadership has been contentious, with some members accusing him of wanting to remain in power forcefully.<br><br>His defense team had requested for a bond, but the magistrate rejected it citing uniform application of the law. He is therefore set for a sentence on November when the court shall determine his verdict after considering a pre-sentence report.<br><br>The conviction however, has brought a sense of relief to some church members who felt that justice has been served.<br><br>The court's decision marked a significant moment in the case, with potential far-reaching implications for church's leadership and stability.<br><br>As the church has been left to pick up the pieces and rebuild its image, the case has served as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability, even in the highest echelons of society.",

He testified that a homemade gun, ammunition and an identity card belonging to the deceased suspect were recovered at the scene. He described the area as \"volatile\" and said he lost 13 officers to criminal attacks while in command.<br><br>The case centres on the death of the suspect, Wickliffe Vincent Owuor, who was shot dead following a confrontation with police officers. Prosecutors allege the officers acted unlawfully and are seeking murder charges. The defence argues the officers acted in self-defence after being fired upon. Omunga's emotional breakdown underlined the weight of the situation both for the officers involved and the community they serve.<br><br>Civil society groups have expressed concern over the heavy use of force by lawenforcement in Nairobi's high crime areas, and this trial is seen as a crucial test of accountability for police shootings. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has been criticised by Omunga for focusing on police conduct while, he claims, ignoring officers' deaths in the line of duty.<br><br>In the gallery sat relatives of both the accused officers and the deceased suspect, all listening in silence as Omunga described the moment of the shooting. Outside the courtroom, residents of Kayole said they welcomed the trial as an opportunity for justice but also voiced concern over the risks faced daily by officers in high crime neighbourhoods.<br><br>As the proceedings continue, the trial is likely to draw national attention, it underscores the delicate balance between security operations and human rights in Kenya's law-enforcement landscape. Many Kenyans will watch closely to see if this case leads to meaningful accountability, or simply another headline in a long series of police related deaths.",

Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi, have been recognized for their work on peripheral immune tolerance, the process by which the immune system avoids attacking the body's own tissues.<br><br>Sakaguchi first identified a previously unknown class of immune cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) in 1995, showing that they act like security guards for the immune system.<br><br>In 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered the gene FOXP3, which is essential for the development and function of those regulatory T cells. They found that mutations in FOXP3 cause a severe autoimmune condition known as IPEX in humans and a related disorder in mice.<br><br>Together, their findings transformed how scientists understand immunity, not just as fighting infection, but also as controlling the immune system so it does not harm the body. These discoveries have paved the way for potential therapies for autoimmune diseases, cancer immunotherapy and better organ-transplant treatment.<br><br>Brunkow, born 1961, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Ramsdell, born 1960, is a scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco while Sakaguchi, born 1951, is a distinguished Professor at Osaka University in Japan.<br><br>The announcement was made by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm on 6 October 2025, and the winners are set to receive their awards in December.<br><br>Their work underscores the delicate balance at the heart of human health, a powerful immune system that must also be restrained to prevent self-attack. With these findings, the \"brakes\" of the immune system are now understood, and medicine may harness them to treat disease more precisely than ever before.",

The loss comes just seven months after the death of his former partner, singer Angie Stone, leaving their son Michael Archer Jr., known professionally as Swayvo Twain, mourning both parents within the same year.<br><br>Born on February 11, 1974, in Richmond, Virginia, D'Angelo rose to fame in the 1990s as a pioneer of the neo-soul genre. His debut album, Brown Sugar (1995) was certified platinum and credited with reshaping R&B through smooth, soulful melodies and heartfelt lyricism. The album included hits like \"Lady,\" \"Cruisin,\" and the title track, earning him widespread acclaim.<br><br>His second album, Voodoo (2000), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and cemented his legacy. The single \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" and its powerful video became cultural touchstones, winning him Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Album. Voodoo later ranked 28th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.<br><br>Despite his success, D'Angelo struggled with depression and substance abuse in the early 2000s, leading to a long break from music. After years away from the spotlight, he made a triumphant return with Black Messiah (2014), a socially conscious and musically rich album that won two Grammy Awards, including Best R&B Album.<br><br>D'Angelo's influence extended far beyond his discography. Billboard named him among the greatest R&B artists, and in 2025, he was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. His artistry inspired a generation of musicians, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.<br><br>His three children, Michael Jr., Imani and a younger son born in 2010, survive him. D'Angelo's music, voice, and vision remain timeless reminders of the soul and vulnerability that defined his remarkable career.",
